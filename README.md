# Chimney: A Coding Language
I've had a concept recently, where I wanted to create something big.  
*Really, really big.* Yes. A whole coding language, written in Python.  
It will not be complete, but very simple. The syntax will be in plain english, like this:  
```
say hello
```
For variables:  
```
say #variable
```
And much more like:  
```
variable = hello
```
And (maybe) packages:
```
get package from .url
```
**So yeah.** That's Chimney. I'll be working on it for a few weeks, to see how it goes.  
Note: I **will** be using tutorials :P
